## Goal

Turn the Claim 1 bridge into an explicit continuum template with:

1. exact object classes,
2. exact topologies,
3. explicit renormalization/counterterm maps,
4. a convergence statement with named proof obligations.

## 1) Object Classes and Topologies

Let \((X_N,\pi_{N+1\to N})\) be a projective system with \(X_N=\mathbb R^{d_N}\) (or smooth finite-dimensional manifolds in charts), \(d_N\uparrow\infty\).

Define the cylinder algebra
\[
\mathrm{Cyl}
:=
\bigcup_{m\ge 1}\{F=F_m\circ\pi_{\infty\to m}\,:\,F_m\in C_b^2(X_m)\}.
\]

For each \(m\), define seminorms on cylinder representatives:
\[
p_{m,0}(F):=\|F_m\|_\infty,\qquad
p_{m,2}(F):=\max_{|\alpha|\le 2}\|\partial^\alpha F_m\|_\infty.
\]
The initial locally convex topology generated by \(\{p_{m,0},p_{m,2}\}\) is denoted \(\tau_{\mathrm{cyl}}\).  
Write \(\overline{\mathrm{Cyl}}^{\,\tau_{\mathrm{cyl}}}\) for its completion.

## 2) Renormalized Oscillatory Family

At scale \(N\), define bare action \(S_N^{\mathrm{bare}}\) and counterterm basis \(\{C_{a,N}\}_{a=1}^{A_N}\).  
Renormalized action:
\[
S_N^{\mathrm{ren}}(x;g_N)
=
S_N^{\mathrm{bare}}(x;g_N)+\sum_{a=1}^{A_N}c_a(N)\,C_{a,N}(x).
\]

Normalized oscillatory state at fixed \(\varepsilon>0\):
\[
\omega_{\varepsilon,N}(F_m)
:=
\frac{\int_{X_N} e^{\frac{i}{\varepsilon}S_N^{\mathrm{ren}}(x)}\,(F_m\circ\pi_{N\to m})(x)\,d\mu_N(x)}
{\int_{X_N} e^{\frac{i}{\varepsilon}S_N^{\mathrm{ren}}(x)}\,d\mu_N(x)},
\qquad N\ge m.
\]

Renormalization map notation:
\[
\mathcal R_N:\ (g_N^{\mathrm{bare}},c_\bullet(N))\mapsto g_N^{\mathrm{ren}},
\]
with compatibility constraints specified below.

## 3) Hypothesis Package (Continuum Skeleton)

### H1 (Projective Compatibility)

\(S_{N+1}^{\mathrm{ren}}(x,\xi)=S_N^{\mathrm{ren}}(x)+\Delta S_{N+1}(x,\xi)\), with a decomposition compatible with \(\pi_{N+1\to N}\) and with observable lifting \(F_m\circ\pi_{N+1\to m}\).

### H2 (Uniform Nondegeneracy in Controlled Charts)

On stationary neighborhoods relevant for cylinder observables, Hessian blocks satisfy
\[
0<\lambda_-\le \sigma_{\min}\!\big(\nabla^2 S_N^{\mathrm{ren}}\big)\le
\sigma_{\max}\!\big(\nabla^2 S_N^{\mathrm{ren}}\big)\le \lambda_+<\infty
\]
with constants independent of \(N\) after renormalization.

### H3 (Normalization Nonvanishing)

There exists \(\varepsilon_0>0\) such that \(Z_{\varepsilon,N}\neq 0\) for all \(0<\varepsilon\le\varepsilon_0\), all large \(N\), where
\[
Z_{\varepsilon,N}:=\int_{X_N}e^{\frac{i}{\varepsilon}S_N^{\mathrm{ren}}}\,d\mu_N.
\]

### H4 (Counterterm Regularity / Flow Control)

Counterterms are local (in the truncation sense) and satisfy a bounded flow condition:
\[
|c_a(N+1)-c_a(N)|\le \kappa_a\,N^{-1-\eta}
\]
for some \(\eta>0\) on the selected renormalized trajectory.

### H5 (Cylinder Continuity)

For each \(m\), \(\omega_{\varepsilon,N}(F_m)\) is uniformly continuous in \(F_m\) w.r.t. \(p_{m,0}+p_{m,2}\), uniformly for \(N\ge m\).

### H6 (Cauchy Tail Bound)

For each cylinder \(F=F_m\circ\pi_{\infty\to m}\), there exists \(\alpha_m(N,N')\to 0\) as \(N,N'\to\infty\) such that
\[
|\omega_{\varepsilon,N}(F_m)-\omega_{\varepsilon,N'}(F_m)|
\le
\alpha_m(N,N')\,(p_{m,0}(F)+p_{m,2}(F)).
\]

### H7 (Semiclassical Channel Control, Optional Step)

As \(\varepsilon\to 0\), each \(\omega_{\varepsilon,N}\) admits a stationary/channel expansion with remainder estimates uniform in \(N\) over admissible cylinder classes.

## 4) Continuum Template Statement

Under H1-H6:

1. For each fixed \(0<\varepsilon\le \varepsilon_0\), \(\omega_{\varepsilon,N}\) converges on \(\mathrm{Cyl}\) to a linear functional \(\omega_\varepsilon\).
2. \(\omega_\varepsilon\) is \(\tau_{\mathrm{cyl}}\)-continuous and extends to \(\overline{\mathrm{Cyl}}^{\,\tau_{\mathrm{cyl}}}\).
3. The extension is independent of truncation representative for a given cylinder observable.

If H7 also holds:

4. The semiclassical limit \(\varepsilon\to 0\) of \(\omega_\varepsilon\) decomposes into point-supported scaling channels (including \(\delta^{(m)}\)-type contributions), matching the Claim 1 channel program.

Status: this is a rigorous template, not yet a completed theorem in this workspace.

## 5) Proof Skeleton (What Must Be Closed)

1. Prove H6 from H1-H5 for a concrete model class (start with Gaussian + local polynomial perturbations).
2. Show that counterterm flow in H4 is enough to enforce H2/H3 uniformly.
3. Prove representative-independence for lifted cylinder observables under projective maps.
4. Establish an extension theorem from \(\mathrm{Cyl}\) to \(\overline{\mathrm{Cyl}}^{\,\tau_{\mathrm{cyl}}}\).
5. Add channel-uniform stationary-phase estimates for H7.

## 6) Diagnostics and Existing Script Hooks

Use the following measurable diagnostics:

1. Cauchy-tail defect:
   \[
   D_{\varepsilon,m}(N,N';F):=
   |\omega_{\varepsilon,N}(F_m)-\omega_{\varepsilon,N'}(F_m)|.
   \]
2. Nondegeneracy tracker: \(\min \sigma_{\min}(\nabla^2 S_N^{\mathrm{ren}})\).
3. Counterterm-drift tracker: \(\max_a |c_a(N+1)-c_a(N)|\).

## 7) Next Target After This Skeleton

Write a theorem-grade Gaussian model closure proving H1-H6 in full detail for an explicit truncation family, then extend by perturbative stability bounds.
