# Claim 1 Phase AN: Field-Level Existence Roadmap by Spacetime Dimension

Date: 2026-02-09 (CET)  
Depends on: `research/workspace/notes/theorems/2026-02-09-claim1-three-level-program.md`

## Purpose

Turn the field-level part of Goal 1 into a dimension-gated proof program.

## Existence Notions (Field Level)

For each spacetime dimension \(d\), distinguish:

1. **Regulated existence**: finite cutoff/lattice and finite volume objects are well-defined.
2. **Continuum existence**: removal of regulator/volume with nontrivial limit.
3. **Physical reconstruction**: Euclidean-to-Minkowski reconstruction (or equivalent axiomatic bridge) in the model class.

Claim 1 only upgrades to field-level closure in a branch when all three are addressed in that branch.

## Dimension Gate

### \(d=2\) (first closure target)

Program stance:

1. treat \(d=2\) interacting scalar classes as the primary candidate for first full field-level closure;
2. prove Claim 1-style localization/SD/\(c\)-invariance statements inside a model where continuum existence is strongest.

Half-density branching:

1. amplitude/half-density language can be used as structural interpretation,
2. correlator/Schwinger-function branch can carry the strict existence proof.

### \(d=3\) (second closure target)

Program stance:

1. move next to superrenormalizable interacting classes in \(d=3\),
2. document every added renormalization assumption versus \(d=2\).

Half-density branching:

1. keep half-density interpretation optional,
2. prioritize robust continuum/correlation control first.

### \(d=4\) (frontier target)

Program stance:

1. treat \(d=4\) as physically central and mathematically frontier-sensitive,
2. split results into:
   - theorem-grade scoped statements,
   - explicit open hypotheses needed for full continuum nontriviality.

Half-density branching:

1. admissible as formal/compositional language,
2. not accepted as substitute for continuum existence proof.

### \(d>4\) (EFT branch)

Program stance:

1. default to EFT/scaling analysis unless a specific UV-complete model is fixed,
2. keep out of the near-term closure queue.

## Immediate Claim 1 Deliverables

1. **AN-1 (next):** write a \(d=2\) theorem candidate that upgrades the finite-dimensional \(c\)-invariant SD chain to a genuine field-indexed cylinder family with explicit continuum assumptions.
2. **AN-2:** add a proof-obstruction note listing exactly which estimates fail (or are missing) when naively lifting AN-1 to \(d=4\).
3. **AN-3:** add a half-density compatibility lemma stating what is purely kinematic (composition/Jacobian) and what is genuinely dynamical (existence/renormalization).

## Non-Drift Rule

Any new field-level theorem note must start with:

1. target dimension \(d\),
2. model class,
3. existence notion being claimed (regulated / continuum / reconstruction),
4. whether half-density is used as core formalism or as interpretation only.
