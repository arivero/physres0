# Theme: Can a Central Potential Be Generated by a Fermionic Field?

Date: 2026-02-10 (US)

## Question

In what precise sense can a *fermionic* field generate an effective *central potential* between sources?
Does the spin/statistics structure force the interaction to be short-range and/or point-supported (contact),
unless special boundary conditions or composite (bosonic) operators are involved?

This theme is motivated by the (speculative) analogy:
bosonic massive mediators yield Yukawa short-range forces; fermionic mediators may be obstructed by spin/angle structure,
perhaps leaving only contact terms or boundary-condition encoded interactions.

## What our conversation already contains (internal anchors)

1. Higher-dimensional extension explicitly flags “fermions?” as potentially needed structure:
   `conv_patched.md:816`.
2. The dimensional-analysis discussion explicitly points to *contact interactions* as a limit regime:
   `conv_patched.md:1816`–`conv_patched.md:1818` (Fermi-theory contact interaction remark).

## Minimal clean framing (avoid category errors)

### What “a potential generated by a field” usually means

Operational definition (scattering/EFT):
compute a low-momentum transfer amplitude \(\mathcal M(\mathbf q)\) between two sources,
then define a position-space potential by Fourier transform (in a specified nonrelativistic/static regime),
schematically
\[
V(\mathbf r)\ \propto\ \int\frac{d^3q}{(2\pi)^3}\,e^{i\mathbf q\cdot\mathbf r}\,\mathcal M(\mathbf q).
\]
For **bosonic** mediator exchange, \(\mathcal M(\mathbf q)\sim g^2/(\mathbf q^2+m^2)\) gives Yukawa \(V(r)\sim e^{-mr}/r\).

### Why “single fermion exchange” is not a generic static potential mechanism

A fermion field \(\psi\) is Grassmann-odd.
Coupling a *bosonic* classical source linearly to \(\psi\) is not a standard bosonic-source construction
(a linear source \(J\psi\) would require \(J\) to be Grassmann-odd).

Therefore, potentials between bosonic sources mediated by fermions arise (if at all) via **bosonic fermion bilinears**
such as \(\bar\psi\psi\) or \(\bar\psi\gamma^\mu\psi\), i.e. via composite operators.
That typically means:
- the leading long-distance interaction is **two-fermion exchange** (a branch cut / threshold at \(2m\)),
- the low-energy limit produces **local operators** (contact terms) when \(|\mathbf q|\ll m\).

This aligns with the “maybe only point-supported potentials / boundary conditions” hypothesis in the prompt.

## One concrete cross-check (EFT → point-supported)

If \(\mathcal M(\mathbf q)\) is analytic near \(\mathbf q=0\), then it admits an expansion
\[
\mathcal M(\mathbf q)=c_0 + c_2\,\mathbf q^2 + \cdots.
\]
Fourier transforming term-by-term gives
- \(c_0\) ↦ \(c_0\,\delta^{(3)}(\mathbf r)\) (contact interaction),
- \(c_2\,\mathbf q^2\) ↦ a Laplacian of a delta (derivative contact term),
and so on.

So: **analytic low-momentum exchange data corresponds to point-supported interactions.**
Any genuinely long-range tail must come from non-analytic structure in \(\mathcal M\) (massless poles or thresholds),
and a fermion mass threshold naturally starts at \(2m\), suggesting tails \(\sim e^{-2mr}\) rather than \(e^{-mr}\) when mediated by fermion pairs.

## How this connects to existing lanes in this repo

1. The “point-supported sector” is already an explicit theme in Claim 1 work (delta/derivative-of-delta channels, contact-interaction RG notes).
2. The physarticle extraction backlog already mentions self-adjoint extension / boundary-condition encoding for s-wave point interactions;
   see `research/workspace/notes/audits/2026-02-10-physarticle-tex-claims-extraction.md`.

## Validation Contract

### Assumptions

1. We are discussing static/NR potentials extracted from amplitudes (not fully relativistic bound-state dynamics).
2. “Generated by a fermionic field” is interpreted as “arises after integrating out fermions” (effective interaction).
3. No claim is made here that a *purely* spin-independent central potential is impossible; the claim is only about the generic mechanism and what is naturally produced in EFT.

### Units and dimensions check

1. In 3+1D, integrating out a heavy field typically yields operators suppressed by powers of the mediator mass;
   the corresponding potential terms have support/scale consistent with those dimensions (contact terms for analytic expansions).

### Symmetry/conservation checks

1. Central potential requires rotational invariance; fermion-mediated interactions generally carry spin dependence unless projected/averaged.
2. Any proposed effective central potential must state whether it is spin-averaged, spin-singlet, or genuinely spin-independent.

### Independent cross-check path

EFT analyticity → δ/derivative-of-δ contact terms cross-check included above.
Next cross-check (queued): identify the first non-analytic threshold in a concrete model and compute the large-`r` asymptotic (expected `~e^{-2mr}`).

### Confidence statement

High confidence on the “analytic in \(\mathbf q\) ⇒ contact in \(\mathbf r\)” implication and on the need for bilinear/composite couplings for bosonic sources;
medium confidence on the precise power-law prefactor multiplying `e^{-2mr}` without doing the explicit spectral/dispersion computation.
