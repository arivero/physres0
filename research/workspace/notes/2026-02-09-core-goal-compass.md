# Core Goal Compass (Foundational Track)

Date: 2026-02-09

## North Star

Understand, rigorously, how quantum formalism appears when variational mechanics is made distributionally consistent across:

1. static problems,
2. mechanics on time-lines,
3. field theory on spacetime,

and connect that emergence to geometric descriptions of forces.

## Canonical Source Anchors (`conv_patched.md`)

- Variational/distribution seed: `conv_patched.md:681`, `conv_patched.md:684`, `conv_patched.md:733`, `conv_patched.md:1085`.
- Halved/amplitude-half-density interpretation: `conv_patched.md:710`, `conv_patched.md:932`, `conv_patched.md:1195`.
- Scale/refinement/RG/tangent-groupoid control: `conv_patched.md:795`, `conv_patched.md:799`, `conv_patched.md:1118`, `conv_patched.md:1207`.
- Action -> force/geodesic/gauge bridge: `conv_patched.md:549`, `conv_patched.md:595`, `conv_patched.md:601`, `conv_patched.md:611`.

## Immediate Execution Priorities

1. Close Claim 1 frontier: non-perturbative multi-mode quartic de-regularization \(\eta\to0^+\) with large-\(N\) control.
2. Produce a single synthesis theorem note: action reduction as the common mechanism for SR/GR/gauge force descriptions.
3. Tie Schwinger-Dyson/\(\tau\)-flow statements back to tangent-groupoid scale language in one formal dependency map.

## Progress (This Pass)

- Priority 1 completed (Phase AG): \(\eta\to0^+\) de-regularization note for finite-\(g\) multi-mode quartic sector.
- Priority 2 completed (Phase AH): unified action-reduction synthesis note across SR/GR/gauge.
- Follow-up completed (Phase AI): consolidated lecture manuscript "Newton -> action -> path integral" with explicit dependency graph.
- Priority 3 completed (Phase AJ): tangent-groupoid/\(\tau_\mu\)/Schwinger-Dyson dependency sheet.
- Integration completed (Phase AK): \(c\)-invariance dependency logic wired into the scoped Claim 1 manuscript.
- Frontier step completed (Phase AL): first explicit continuum-limit theorem candidate using the \(c\)-invariance backbone.

## De-Prioritized Unless Supporting North Star

- Additional rotating-black-hole taxonomy refinements.
- Additional phase-taxonomy refinements for gauge long-range classes.

These are kept secondary unless they directly improve the foundational thread above.
