# Research Pool (Themes Queue)

Date: 2026-02-10 (US)

## Scope

This file tracks *non-core* themes/questions added to the workspace research pool.
They are not part of the Top-10 claim audit unless explicitly promoted.

Non-drift rule:
each theme must either (i) support the Foundational axis (Claim 1 framing / Newton-limit paradox / action→amplitude), or
(ii) have a clear physics-side payoff with an explicit validation plan.

## Themes (Queued)

### Theme 1 — Action–Angle “Undeterminacy” for Central Potentials

Question:
What is the precise, theorem-grade statement (if any) behind an “action–angle undeterminacy principle” in QM,
and what does it say in the integrable *central potential* setting?

Primary internal anchors:
- `conv_patched.md:1779` (Bohr–Sommerfeld quantization via Newton/area language; central-force framing)
- `conv_patched.md:2214` (action variable `J = ∮ p dq` as symplectic area; action additivity → refinement stability)

Supporting note (this repo):
- `research/workspace/notes/2026-02-10-theme-action-angle-undeterminacy-central-potentials.md`

Why it’s in the pool:
- Connects the “area/action invariants” thread in `conv_patched.md` to concrete QM complementarity in a setting where we already have many proved central-force notes (Claims 2–4).

Next deliverables:
1. Extract a clean definition of action–angle variables for central potentials (`J_r, J_θ, J_φ`) and identify which “angle operator” notion (self-adjoint vs POVM vs unitary `e^{iθ}`) we will use.
2. Produce one page with a *dimension/units* check and one *symmetry* check (rotations; conserved `L, L_z`).
3. Independent cross-check: derive the Bohr–Sommerfeld/EBK quantization of `J` for one worked central example (Coulomb or isotropic oscillator) and compare to the known spectrum (with Maslov index stated explicitly).

Status: deferred at closure (2026-02-13).  Initial deliverable completed; full formalization deferred.

### Theme 2 — Can a Central Potential Be Generated by a Fermionic Field?

Question:
In what precise sense can a *fermionic* QFT degree of freedom generate an effective *central potential* between sources?
If it can, is the long-range piece necessarily absent, leaving only contact/point-supported terms or special boundary conditions?

Primary internal anchors:
- `conv_patched.md:816` (explicit “fermions?” flag in the higher-dimensional extension discussion)
- `conv_patched.md:1816`–`conv_patched.md:1818` (Fermi contact-interaction remark; fermions vs EW bosons)

Supporting note (this repo):
- `research/workspace/notes/2026-02-10-theme-fermionic-mediation-central-potential.md`

Why it’s in the pool:
- Clarifies the “mediator → potential” logic behind Claim 9 language and connects to the already-developed point-supported/contact-interaction lane (also relevant to the “boundary condition / self-adjoint extension” workflow).

Next deliverables:
1. Fix the model class and regime: relativistic QFT in 3+1 with static sources, or NR EFT matching at `|q|≪m`.
2. Prove/record the *selection rule* behind “no single-fermion exchange static potential between bosonic sources” (source statistics / Lorentz representation), and what replaces it (bilinear coupling → two-fermion exchange or local operators).
3. Independent cross-check: show that analytic low-momentum amplitudes expand to δ/derivative-of-δ contact terms in position space (point-supported), and identify the first non-analytic threshold controlling the large-`r` tail (expected `~e^{-2mr}` behavior).

Status: deferred at closure (2026-02-13).  Initial deliverable completed; full formalization deferred.

## Validation Contract (for this queue file)

### Assumptions

1. This is a *task queue* and topic-framing file; no new theorem is claimed here.
2. “Queued” means the topic has a concrete next deliverable and a cross-check path.

### Units and dimensions check

Deferred to each theme note (each theme must include its own units/dimensions section).

### Symmetry/conservation checks

Deferred to each theme note (each theme must include its own symmetry section).

### Independent cross-check path

Each theme’s “Next deliverables” includes at least one independent cross-check lane.

### Confidence statement

High confidence the listed anchors exist in `conv_patched.md`; medium confidence on which formalization route (operator vs POVM, dispersion vs EFT) will be fastest without external literature downloads.
